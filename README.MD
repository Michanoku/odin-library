The Odin Project Library Project

For this project the goal was to create library objects and an array, and have functions to
populate the page and allow for manipulation of the array and objects and thus the page.

I stayed mostly close to the requirements, just playing around a bit with CSS grid and other
CSS features to practice. 

The struggle for smaller commits is real at this point. I just can't seem to stop getting into
a longer coding flow, during which I forget comments as well as commits. I wonder what would
be the best way to tackle this. I will keep trying but I'm not seeing much progress lately.
This should be a primary focus for me in the coming exercises.
